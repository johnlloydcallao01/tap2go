# Upload Auto-Refresh Test

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Enhanced useMediaLibrary Hook** (`src/hooks/useMediaLibrary.ts`)
- **Added auto-refresh after upload**: When files are successfully uploaded, they are automatically added to the current file list
- **Updated state management**: New files are prepended to the existing file list
- **Updated pagination**: Total count is incremented by the number of successful uploads

### 2. **Enhanced Media Page** (`src/app/admin/cms/media/page.tsx`)
- **Added useEffect for initial load**: Files are loaded when the component mounts
- **Enhanced upload handler**: Checks for successful uploads and refreshes the list if filters are active
- **Improved upload progress display**: Shows success/error states with colored indicators

### 3. **Smart Refresh Logic**
- **No filters**: New files appear immediately at the top of the list
- **With filters**: Automatically refreshes the entire list to ensure consistency
- **Upload progress**: Shows real-time upload status with success/error indicators

## How It Works:

1. **Upload Process**:
   - Files are uploaded via the `uploadFiles` function
   - Each successful upload returns a `MediaFile` object
   - These objects are immediately added to the current state

2. **State Update**:
   - Successful uploads are prepended to the `files` array
   - Pagination total is updated to reflect new files
   - Upload progress shows success indicators

3. **Filter Handling**:
   - If no filters are active, files appear immediately
   - If filters are active, the entire list is refreshed to ensure consistency
   - This prevents issues where uploaded files might not match current filter criteria

## Testing:

1. **No Filters**: Upload a file and it should appear immediately at the top
2. **With Filters**: Upload a file and the list should refresh to show current results
3. **Upload Progress**: Should show "✅ Uploaded" for successful uploads
4. **Error Handling**: Failed uploads show "❌ Failed" with error details

## Benefits:

- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Users see uploaded files right away
- ✅ **No Manual Refresh**: No need to reload the browser
- ✅ **Filter Consistency**: Handles filtered views correctly
- ✅ **Professional UX**: Similar to Google Photos, Dropbox, etc.
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear indication of upload success/failure
