# React Native Syntax Error Fix

## Problem
The React Native app was failing to bundle with a syntax error:
```
Android Bundling failed 21169ms apps\mobile-customer\index.ts (949 modules)
ERROR  SyntaxError: C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\tap2go\apps\mobile-customer\src\contexts\ThemeContext.tsx: Identifier 'useIsDarkMode' has already been declared. (269:13)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by a duplicate declaration of the `useIsDarkMode` function in the `ThemeContext.tsx` file. During the dark mode implementation, the function was accidentally declared twice:

1. First declaration at line 263
2. Duplicate declaration at line 269

This created a JavaScript syntax error where the same identifier was being exported twice from the same module.

## Investigation Process
1. **Initial Analysis**: The error pointed to line 269 in ThemeContext.tsx
2. **File Inspection**: Found that the file only had 267 lines, suggesting Metro cache issues
3. **Cache Issues**: Metro bundler was using a cached version of the file with the duplicate
4. **Multiple Cache Clear Attempts**: Standard cache clearing didn't resolve the issue
5. **Workaround Strategy**: Temporarily renamed the function to force cache invalidation

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Function Declaration
The duplicate `useIsDarkMode` function was removed from the ThemeContext.tsx file:

**Before (with duplicate):**
```typescript
// Helper hook for getting dark mode status
export const useIsDarkMode = (): boolean => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  return theme.isDark;
};

// Helper hook for checking if dark mode is active
export const useIsDarkMode = (): boolean => {  // ← DUPLICATE
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  return theme.isDark;
};
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
// Helper hook for getting dark mode status
export const useIsDarkMode = (): boolean => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  return theme.isDark;
};
```

### 2. Cache Invalidation Strategy
To force Metro bundler to recognize the changes:
1. **Temporarily renamed** the function to `useIsDarkModeStatus`
2. **Updated all imports** in dependent files
3. **Started Metro bundler** with `--clear` flag
4. **Verified successful bundling** without errors
5. **Renamed back** to original `useIsDarkMode`
6. **Updated imports back** to original names

### 3. Verified TypeScript Compilation
Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` to ensure no TypeScript errors remained.

## Files Modified
- `apps/mobile-customer/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Removed duplicate function
- `apps/mobile-customer/src/components/DarkModeTest.tsx` - Temporarily updated imports
- `apps/mobile-customer/src/components/ThemeDebugger.tsx` - Temporarily updated imports  
- `apps/mobile-customer/src/components/SystemThemeValidator.tsx` - Temporarily updated imports

## Result
✅ **Metro bundler now starts successfully**
✅ **No syntax errors**
✅ **All TypeScript compilation passes**
✅ **App runs on port 8083**
✅ **QR code displays for development builds**

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. **Use TypeScript strict mode** to catch duplicate declarations
2. **Run `npx tsc --noEmit`** before committing changes
3. **Use IDE with TypeScript integration** to catch errors in real-time
4. **Clear Metro cache** when encountering persistent bundling issues
5. **Avoid copy-pasting function declarations** without removing originals

## Metro Cache Management
When encountering persistent bundling errors:
1. **Standard cache clear**: `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Reset cache**: `npx expo start --reset-cache`
3. **Manual cache removal**: Delete `.expo` and `node_modules/.cache` directories
4. **Function renaming**: Temporarily rename problematic functions to force cache invalidation
5. **Port change**: Use different port if cache issues persist

## Technical Notes
- Metro bundler can sometimes cache problematic code even after file changes
- The error line number (269) was higher than actual file length (267), indicating cache issues
- Temporary function renaming is an effective cache invalidation strategy
- TypeScript compilation success doesn't guarantee Metro bundling success due to different caching mechanisms

The syntax error is now completely resolved and the app bundles successfully.
