❌ Critical Issues & Missing Pieces
1. Zero Shared Package Usage

// Current package.json - NO workspace dependencies
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "53.0.17",
    "react-native": "0.79.5"
    // 120+ dependencies but ZERO "workspace:*" packages!
  }
}



2. Duplicate Code Everywhere
Types: Local interfaces duplicate shared-types (User, Restaurant, MenuItem)
Business Logic: Manual price calculations instead of using business-logic
API Calls: No api-client usage - everything is hardcoded
Configuration: Separate config instead of using config package
Utilities: Local responsive system instead of shared utilities
3. Mock Data Dependencies
All screens use hardcoded mock data instead of real API integration:



// HomeScreen.tsx - All mock data
const mockRestaurants = [/* hardcoded data */];
const mockCategories = [/* hardcoded data */];


4. Navigation System Issues
Custom navigation instead of React Navigation
No deep linking support
No navigation state management
Mock navigation object passed around
5. Missing Core Functionality
No real API integration
No authentication system
No real-time updates
No push notifications
No offline support
No payment integration




🎯 Code Sharing Maximization Strategy
Phase 1: Immediate Shared Package Integration
1. Add Shared Package Dependencies

// apps/mobile-customer/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shared-types": "workspace:*",
    "business-logic": "workspace:*", 
    "api-client": "workspace:*",
    "config": "workspace:*",
    "shared-utils": "workspace:*",
    "firebase-config": "workspace:*"
  }
}



2. Replace Local Types with Shared Types

// Before: Local interface definitions
interface Restaurant { id: string; name: string; }

// After: Import from shared-types
import { Restaurant, MenuItem, User, Order } from 'shared-types';


3. Replace Business Logic with Shared Functions

// Before: Manual calculations
const total = subtotal + tax + deliveryFee;

// After: Use shared business logic
import { calculateOrderTotal } from 'business-logic';
const total = calculateOrderTotal(subtotal, tax, deliveryFee, serviceFee, discount);

Phase 2: Create Mobile-Specific Shared Packages
1. packages/mobile-ui/ - React Native Components

// Mobile-compatible versions of shared UI
export const MobileButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant }) => (
  <TouchableOpacity style={getButtonStyles(variant)}>
    <Text>{children}</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
);

export const MobileCard: React.FC<CardProps> = ({ children }) => (
  <View style={cardStyles}>
    {children}
  </View>
);


2. packages/mobile-navigation/ - Navigation Utilities

// Shared navigation types and utilities
export interface NavigationProps {
  navigate: (screen: string) => void;
  goBack: () => void;
}

export const createNavigationConfig = () => ({
  // Shared navigation configuration
});


3. packages/mobile-auth/ - Authentication Logic

// Mobile-specific auth implementation
export const useMobileAuth = () => {
  // Firebase auth with mobile-specific handling
};

Phase 3: API Integration & Real Data
1. Replace Mock Data with API Calls

// Before: Mock data
const mockRestaurants = [/* hardcoded */];

// After: API integration
import { apiClient } from 'api-client';
const { data: restaurants } = await apiClient.get('/restaurants');


2. Implement Real-time Updates

// Use shared Firebase config for real-time data
import { firebaseConfig } from 'firebase-config';
// Real-time order updates, restaurant status, etc.




📋 Specific Shared Packages to Create/Use
✅ Can Use Immediately (Universal)
shared-types - All TypeScript interfaces
business-logic - Order calculations, validations
shared-utils - Currency formatting, date utilities
config - Environment configuration
api-client - HTTP client setup
firebase-config - Firebase initialization
🆕 Need to Create (Mobile-Specific)
mobile-ui - React Native UI components
mobile-navigation - Navigation utilities
mobile-auth - Authentication hooks
mobile-storage - AsyncStorage utilities
mobile-notifications - Push notification handling
mobile-maps - Maps integration utilities
🔄 Need to Adapt (Platform-Specific)
shared-ui - Create mobile variants of web components
database - Add mobile-specific Firestore operations
💡 Implementation Priority
High Priority (Week 1)
Add shared-types dependency and replace all local interfaces
Add business-logic dependency and replace manual calculations
Add shared-utils dependency for formatting functions
Add config dependency for environment management
Medium Priority (Week 2-3)
Create mobile-ui package with React Native components
Add api-client dependency and replace mock data
Add firebase-config dependency for real authentication
Low Priority (Week 4+)
Create mobile-navigation package
Create mobile-auth package
Add real-time features with shared Firebase config
🎯 Expected Code Sharing Benefits
Immediate Benefits
50% reduction in type definitions (use shared-types)
30% reduction in business logic code (use shared calculations)
Consistent data structures across web and mobile
Unified configuration management
Long-term Benefits
Shared UI components between mobile apps (customer, vendor, driver)
Consistent business rules across all platforms
Unified API client with error handling
Shared authentication logic
Common utilities for formatting, validation, etc.
🚀 Conclusion
Your apps/mobile-customer is a professionally built React Native app with excellent architecture, but it's currently operating as a standalone app that happens to live in a monorepo.

The app has:

✅ Excellent foundation - Professional responsive design, theme system, error handling
✅ Clean architecture - Well-organized components, screens, contexts
✅ Modern tech stack - React 19, TypeScript, Expo SDK 53
❌ Zero code sharing - No shared package usage despite living in a monorepo
❌ Duplicate implementations - Reimplementing what already exists in shared packages
The path to maximizing code sharing is clear: Start with universal packages (shared-types, business-logic, shared-utils), then create mobile-specific packages (mobile-ui, mobile-navigation), and finally integrate real API data.

This will transform your mobile app from a standalone application into a true monorepo citizen that leverages shared code effectively.
