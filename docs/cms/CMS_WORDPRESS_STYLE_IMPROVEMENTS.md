# CMS Dashboard WordPress-Style Improvements

## üéØ **Overview**

The CMS Dashboard has been enhanced with WordPress-style post management features, including proper segmentation, two-stage deletion system, and professional trash management that ensures complete database cleanup.

## ‚ú® **Key Improvements**

### 1. **WordPress-Style Segmentation Menu**
- **All Posts** - Shows all active posts (published + draft)
- **Published** - Shows only published posts
- **Draft** - Shows only draft posts  
- **Trash** - Shows soft-deleted posts

Each tab displays the count of posts in that category, just like WordPress.

### 2. **Two-Stage Deletion System**

#### **Stage 1: Soft Delete (Move to Trash)**
- Posts are moved to trash by setting `deleted_at` timestamp
- Posts remain in database but are hidden from active views
- Can be restored from trash
- Professional and safe approach

#### **Stage 2: Permanent Delete (Hard Delete)**
- **Complete database removal** - Posts are permanently deleted from Neon PostgreSQL
- **No database bloat** - Ensures clean database over time
- **Cannot be undone** - Clear warning messages to prevent accidents
- **Professional approach** - Respects user intention to permanently delete

### 3. **Enhanced User Interface**

#### **Segmentation Tabs**
```
All (4) | Published (2) | Draft (2) | Trash (0)
```

#### **Action Buttons**
- **Active Posts**: View, Edit, Move to Trash
- **Trash Posts**: View, Restore, Permanently Delete

#### **Clear Visual Indicators**
- Different icons for trash vs permanent delete
- Color-coded buttons (orange for trash, red for permanent)
- Warning messages for permanent deletion

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Soft delete column (already exists)
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_blog_posts_deleted_at ON blog_posts(deleted_at);
```

### **API Endpoints**

#### **GET /api/blog/posts**
- Supports filtering: `?status=published` or `?status=draft`
- Returns statistics including trash count
- Only shows non-deleted posts (`deleted_at IS NULL`)

#### **GET /api/blog/posts/bin**
- Returns soft-deleted posts (`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`)
- Ordered by deletion date (newest first)

#### **DELETE /api/blog/posts?id=123**
- **Soft delete**: Sets `deleted_at = NOW()`
- Moves post to trash

#### **PUT /api/blog/posts/restore?id=123**
- **Restore from trash**: Sets `deleted_at = NULL`
- Returns post to active state

#### **DELETE /api/blog/posts/permanent?id=123**
- **Hard delete**: `DELETE FROM blog_posts WHERE id = 123`
- **Completely removes from database**
- Requires post to be in trash first (safety measure)

### **Frontend Components**

#### **WordPress-Style View Modes**
```typescript
type ViewMode = 'all' | 'published' | 'draft' | 'trash';
```

#### **Enhanced Statistics**
```typescript
interface CMSStats {
  totalPosts: number;      // Active posts only
  publishedPosts: number;  // Published posts
  draftPosts: number;      // Draft posts
  trashedPosts: number;    // Posts in trash
  totalViews: number;      // Total views
}
```
